Hangman

A word is chosen randomly from a given list and the player should guess the word by choosing different letters (displayed as buttons having different attributes).

The word appears as underlines - as many underlines as the number of letters.

Once a letter is chosen, if it is correct, it will be displayed in the "underlined word" otherwise a counter will keep track of the wrong letters chosen.

The game has a limited number of mistakes that are accepted. If the word is guessed before wasting all the lives/ tries, a certain message, using a modal, will be displayed.

The same it's happening if all tries have been wasted (but with a different message). Once certain letters have been chosen, the buttons are disabled.

For making this project I used JS and HTML.
